# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented using Python. The projects explore different algorithms and techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and applications in Regression and Natural Language Processing.

## Projects Overview

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbour
   - Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks.
   - **File**: `K_Nearest_Neighbour.py`

### 2. Logistic Regression
   - **Task/Problem Statement**: Solve multi-class classification problems using the Logistic Regression model and visualize errors.
   - **Dataset**: `winequality-white.csv` for wine quality prediction.
   - **File**: `Logistic_Regression.py`

### 3. Multi Layer Perceptron
   - **Task/Problem Statement**: Solve multi-class classification problems using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.
   - **Dataset**: MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification.
   - **File**: `Multi_Layer_Perceptron.py`

### 4. Regression & Natural Language Processing
   - **Task/Problem Statement**: Solve regression and classification problems using numeric and text data.
   - **Dataset**: `EnergyEfficiency.xlsx` for energy analysis.
   - **File**: `Regression_NLP.py`
